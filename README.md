# Problems solved

### multiples_of_3_or_5 - https://projecteuler.net/problem=1
 
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### even_fibonacci_numbers - https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### largest_prime_factor - https://projecteuler.net/problem=3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

### largest_palindrome_product - https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### smallest_multiple - https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### sum_square_difference - https://projecteuler.net/problem=6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is

```
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
```

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is

```
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
```

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is

```
3025 - 385 = 2640
```

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### 10001st prime - https://projecteuler.net/problem=7

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
